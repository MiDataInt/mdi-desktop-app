We hope you will return frequently
to (re)analyze (new) data. To facilitate
this, the launcher app saves configuration states on your computer 
for fast access on return visits.

Three saved states are always available, others you
can create and manage.

### Default

The Default state carries a minimal set of suggested
parameters to start a new configuration.

### Most Recent

The **Most Recent** state holds the configuration parameters
of the last time you connected to a server. It is how the app loads, 
so often you can immediately click Connect and/or Start to get going fast.

### Working

As you edit the launcher configuration, your changes will
be saved temporarily into the Working state.  You can launch
the server from this state, and save it later as below.

### Saved presets

Once you have a configuration you like, simply
click **Save**, give it a useful name, and it will be
available as a preset option on future visits.

Later, you can also select a saved state and **Delete** it.

There is no limit on the number of saved configurations, 
use them to organize your work as matches your needs.
