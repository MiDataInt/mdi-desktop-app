The MDI Desktop App is a cross-platform 
{% include external-link.html href="https://www.electronjs.org/" text="Electron" %}
desktop app.
The MDI Apps Framework that it launches is an 
{% include external-link.html href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" text="R Shiny" %}
interface used to perform data analysis.

There are other ways to run the apps framework, but using the MDI Desktop App
is highly recommended as the simplest way to bring all MDI tools to your computer.

### Install the Desktop App

Details pending.

### Install R

The only other software required to use the Desktop App is
R itself (the app will help you install R Shiny and other required packages).

If you are working in a 
[remote server mode](server-modes#remote-server-mode), 
your server probably already has R available, 
perhaps by calling "module load R/#.#.#" as on UM Great Lakes. 
Please see the server documentation for details.

If you are working in 
[local mode](server-modes#local-computer-mode), 
you need to install R on your 
desktop or laptop computer via the link below 
(note that R Studio is not required):
