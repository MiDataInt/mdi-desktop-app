The MDI Apps Launcher is a simple cross-platform 
{% include external-link.html href="https://www.electronjs.org/" text="Electron" %}
desktop app.
The MDI Apps Framework that it launches is an 
{% include external-link.html href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" text="R Shiny" %}
app used to perform data analysis.

There are other ways to run the apps framework, but using the Apps Launcher
is highly recommended as the simplest way to bring all MDI tools to your desktop computer.

### Install the Apps Launcher

Installation details pending.

### Install R

The only other software required to use the launcher is
R itself (the launcher will help you install R Shiny and other required packages).

If you are working in a 
[remote server mode](server-modes#remote-server-mode), 
that server probably already has R available, 
perhaps by calling "module load R/#.#.#" as on UM Great Lakes. 
Please see your server documentation for details.

If you are working in 
[local mode](server-modes#local-computer-mode), 
you need to install R on your 
desktop or laptop computer via the link below 
(note that R Studio is not required to run the MDI):
