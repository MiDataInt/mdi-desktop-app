The following options are specific to
[cluster node mode]({{ /server-modes#cluster-node-mode | relative_url }}). 
They tell the Slurm scheduler about the job that will run the server 
on a cluster node and how you will pay for it.

### Cluster Account

The name of a valid server account that will 
allow you to submit a job to the cluster via the Slurm `srun` command.

For the UM Great Lakes cluster, this account is
based on the uniqname of the principal investigator. 

**Example**
- johndoe0

Note: **Cluster Account** is distinct from your username on the server.
Please consult your group leader for the proper value to use.

### Job Time Minutes

The integer time in minutes you would like your web server to run.

**Job Time Minutes** is the _maximum_ time that the server will run - 
you will terminate the server when you are done using the launcher app
to avoid accumulating charges. This option is required by Slurm
and prevents you from unwittingly launching a server
that runs perpetually.

### CPUs per Task

The integer number of CPUs you would like assigned
to your web server job. 

Only 1 CPU is required to run the MDI web server, but you may wish 
to request 2 CPUs if you will be performing asynchronous tasks
(recommended). 

Only rare users need to request more than 2 CPUs.

### Memory per CPU

The amount of memory you would like assigned
to _each_ CPU that will run your server. 

The value should be provided with a single-letter lower-case
suffix to indicate the memory unit, e.g., 'm' or 'g' for 
MB or GB, respectively.

**Example (defaults)**
- CPUs per Task = 2
- Memory per CPU = 4g
- 2 * 4 = 8 GB of total requested memory
