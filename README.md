# Michigan Data Interface

The [Michigan Data Interface](https://midataint.github.io/) (MDI) 
is a framework for developing, installing and running 
HPC data analysis pipelines and interactive visualization 
applications within a standardized design interface.

The MDI is separated into 
[two stages of code execution](https://midataint.github.io/docs/analysis-flow/) 
called Stage 1 HPC **pipelines** and Stage 2 web applications (i.e., **apps**).
Collectively, pipelines and apps are known as **tools**.

## Repository contents

This is the repository for the **MDI Desktop App** utility,
an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop app
that makes it easy to configure a connection to the computer
where you will run the
[MDI apps framework](https://midataint.github.io/mdi-apps-framework/docs/overview)
and to install and run the web server, all from your Windows or Mac
computer.
